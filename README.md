Simple encapsulation of Clipper from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsclipper/
to ease node integration.

The Javascript Clipper library performs clipping and offsetting for both lines and polygons. All four boolean clipping operations are supported - intersection, union, difference and exclusive-or. Polygons can be of any shape including self-intersecting polygons.
